### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Amrei Binzer-Panchal

A bioinformatician working for SLU's bioinformatics infrastructure. 

I support research groups at SLU by performing bioinformatic analyses and developing workflows on request. I have started my bioinformatics career with microarrays, but have since worked on sequence based data, performing analyses such as expression analyses, genotyping, single cell analyses, GWAS, metagenomics analyses, and more.
