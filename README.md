<img align="right" src="octocat-1720693885494.png" width="220">


a bioinformatician and the head of SLU's bioinformatics infrastructure, Slubi. 


I support researchers at The Swedish Agricultural University in matters of bioinformatics in a variety of ways, such as performing bioinformatic analyses, developing workflows on request, teaching, or simply answering questions that come up when running analyses. 

With a background in biology and ecology, I have started my bioinformatics career with microarrays, but have since worked on sequence based data, performing analyses such as expression analyses, genotyping, single cell analyses, GWAS, metagenomics analyses, and more.
